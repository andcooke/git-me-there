# Git Me There

Deployed link: [Git Me There](https://andcooke.github.io/git-me-there/)

Deployment Date - July 12,2022


## The Idea:
Where does one go to get specific detailed information about a travel destination? To prepare for vacation we often ask: Should I rent a car? Can I walk around the city? What are the best restaurants? Where will I stay?<BR><BR>

With these questions in mind that any traveler would ask, Git Me There was produced by the Illest Group!<BR><BR>

A traveler could visit the Git Me There site, and type in any destination and instantly be given information about transportation and restaurants.<BR><BR>

## Getting Started:
Any device with access to the internet can use the Git Me There site.

## Prerequisites:

Finding APIs that would work with the idea, and with a good amount of availible requests.
