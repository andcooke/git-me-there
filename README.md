# Git Me There

Deployed link: [Git Me There]()

Deployment Date - July 12,2022


## The Idea:
Where does one go to get specific detailed information about a travel destination? To prepare for vacation we often ask: Should I rent a car? can I walk around the city? what are the best restaurants to eat at? where will I stay?

A traveler could visit the Git me there site, and type in any destination and instantly be given information about transportation and restaurants.
