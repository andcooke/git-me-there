# Git Me There

Deployed link:

Deployment Date - July 12,2022


## The Idea:
Where does one go to get specific detailed information about a travel destination? To prepare for vacation we often ask: Should I rent a car? can I walk around the city? what are the best restaurants to eat at? where will I stay?

With these questions in mind that any traveler would ask, Get me there was produced by the Illest Group!
A traveler could visit the Git me there site, and type in any destination and instantly be given information about transportation and restaurants.

## Getting Started:
